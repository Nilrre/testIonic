            <p> The National Parks Service manages over a million acres of 
              wilderness, ensuring the preservation of these lands for the 
              education and enjoyment of current and future generations. They 
              offer a wealth of information through their website, along with 
              wilderness events and activities across the country. Some of their 
              most valuable resources, however, are the park rangers who can provide 
              insights on topography, weather patterns, and potential hazards. Along 
              with these ‘insider’ tips, make sure you have a very detailed map, and 
              that you have shared your plans and time of return with someone who can 
              contact the authorities if you do not return.

        <ion-card-content>
            <p> Twenty-four US navigational satellites circle the globe, forming the 
              Global Positioning System (GPS). With a radio receiver, it is possible to 
              locate your geographic position to within a few meters anywhere on earth. 
              So accurate and dependable is this system that it has become indispensable 
              for surveying and mapping, logistical supply chains, and transportation 
              safety. For the wilderness adventurer, it has proven a lifesaver many times 
              over. Handheld GPS receivers are designed to be rugged, able to survive and 
              function in severe conditions, and available at outdoor recreation and marine 
              stores for around $100.

          <h1>Nature's Compass</h1>
          <h3>Read nature's directional indicators</h3>
        </ion-card-header>
        <ion-card-content>
            <p> The sun’s journey from east to west gives us one of Nature’s most 
              accurate navigational tools. Find a straight stick, push it into the 
              ground, and mark the tip of the shadow to represent west. After about 
              twenty minutes, mark the tip of the shadow again and connect the dots 
              with a straight line to represent east to west. If you stand with the 
              first mark to your left and the second to your right, you will be facing 
              north. Under cloudy skies, look for moss, which always grows more 
              prolifically on the north side of slopes and trees. Spiders, however, 
              prefer a warmer spot, spinning their webs on the south side of trees.

          <h1>Make your own Compass</h1>
          <h3>Three simple ingredients to help you find your way</h3>
        </ion-card-header>
        <ion-card-content>
            <p> To make a compass, you need a small container of water – large leaf, 
              seashell, or plastic jar lid, a compass needle, and a way to suspend the 
              needle on top of the water. The best needle is a sewing needle, something 
              that should always be in your emergency kit. A paperclip, razor blade, or 
              safety pin will also work. To work, however, your needle has to be 
              magnetized. Going in the same direction, rub a magnet against the needle 25 
              – 30 times. Float the needle on a leaf in the water and wait for it to 
              orient itself from North to South.

        <ion-card-content>
            <p> In the northern hemisphere, use the north star to measure your 
              approximate latitude; just point one arm at the star, stretch the 
              other arm horizontal, and estimate the angle. Contrary to popular 
              belief, the North Star is not that bright; it blends into the backdrop 
              of stars. To find it, look for the ‘Big Dipper’ and follow the line created 
              by the two points at the front of the ‘ladle’ directly to the North Star. 
              Named ‘Polaris’, the North Star is also the tip of the handle of the ‘Little 
              Dipper’.

          <h1>Forge the River</h1>
          <h3>How to safely cross a river</h3>
        </ion-card-header>
        <ion-card-content>
            <p> Crossing a river without a bridge (or a kayak) can be a dangerous 
              undertaking, even for the experienced outdoorsman. Do not try to cross a 
              swollen river; their currents can be treacherous and one slip on an algae 
              covered rock has the potential of causing fatal injury. Once water levels 
              drop and currents slow, you can choose the safest places to cross by 
              reading the water. Washboard like ripples across the water indicates 
              shallow depth, a good place to cross. Stay downstream of logs and boulders 
              to avoid being swept into them and look for eddies if you need a break from 
              swift running currents. Eddies, found directly downstream of large obstacles, 
              are areas of calm water out of the flowing currents.

          <h3>Rivers are nature's highways</h3>
        </ion-card-header>
        <ion-card-content>
          <p> From its source high in the mountains, water runs downhill, collecting to form 
            tributaries and rivers until finally reaching its destination – an ocean, bay, or 
            lake. In the northern hemisphere, water tends to run south, away from the North 
            Pole. This southerly flow, however, is often interrupted by the topography of the 
            land, sometimes completely changing the directional movement of the water. The only 
            way to know the river’s path is to research the area before going in. Two rules will 
            always hold true: water runs downhill, and if you follow it, you will eventually reach 
            the confluence of the river and another body of water.

            <h3>Stay dry while crossing a stream</h3>
          </ion-card-header>
          <ion-card-content>
            <p> Unless you are hiking in a desert wilderness area, chances are you will come upon 
              a stream or two that you need to cross without getting your feet wet. If it is a 
              small stream and you have good balance, a simple log pushed across the water to the 
              other bank will do. A more stable bridge would involve two logs placed two feet apart, 
              both long enough to span the creek with a foot or two on each side. Gather stout sticks 
              – 3” or more in diameter – for the cross members, place them closely together and lash 
              each one to the top of the two foundation logs.
