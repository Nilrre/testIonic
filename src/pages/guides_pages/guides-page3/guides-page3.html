          <h3>How to choose your campsite</h3>
        </ion-card-header>
        <ion-card-content>
            <p> Comfort and safety depend on your choice of campsite. The ideal site will 
              have flat, even ground with open space for a kitchen area and perhaps a play 
              area. Look for potential hazards from above – dead tree limbs or loose rock 
              ledges. Camping in the open through a stormy night is not fun and can be very 
              dangerous, so listen to the weather forecast. Locate your tents in an area that 
              receives morning shade. And stay a good distance away from the water’s edge 
              because of flooding potential and the presence of animals and insects.

          <h1>Shelter from the Rain</h1>
          <h3>How to build an open shelter</h3>
        </ion-card-header>
        <ion-card-content>
            <p> Lightweight and compact, tarps offer flexibility in shelter configuration 
              and are the quickest way to provide protection from the rain. A-frame 
              construction prevents water from collecting on the tarp and causing it to fail. 
              To make a simple A-frame shelter, stretch out a length of Paracord and tie each 
              end to a tree at the same height – high enough for maneuver under the shelter; 
              throw the tarp over this centerline. Attach individual ropes to the four corners 
              of the tarp; secure them with tent stakes, rocks, or tie them to other trees.

        <ion-card-content>
            <p> You forgot the tent, and it will be getting dark soon; you must have shelter 
              against the cold night temperatures. You can use what is around you to build a 
              leaf hut, an A-frame shaped wedge that is weatherproof and insulated. Choose a 
              straight, stout limb that is 10’ – 12’ long for the backbone of your shelter. 
              Secure one end in a group of rocks or a tree fork, keeping the central rib oriented 
              at an upward 30° angle. Use two forked sticks to secure the other end of the limb, 
              forming a triangle. Down each side, place sturdy branches closely together at an 
              angle, one end on the ground and the other on the central limb. Cover the frame with 
              a couple of feet of vegetative matter – leaves, moss, and pine needles.

            <p> The wet ground does not make for a restful sleep; neither does the thought 
              of crawling insects or worse. To turn a tarp into a hammock, find two suitable 
              trees about 10’ apart. Spread out the tarp and, beginning at one end, roll the 
              two sides toward the middle and each other. Bind the rope around the two bundles 
              tightly, 18” from the end of the tarp; fold the end over and wrap the rope around 
              the fold several times, securing it with 2 – 3 half-hitch knots. Repeat the process 
              of making a loop on the other end of the tarp. Tie one end of a 15’ length of rope 
              through each “eye” and the other end to one of the trees.

        <ion-card-content>
            <p> Stay dry and comfortable with a greater level of protection from wandering 
              wildlife by sleeping in the trees. Tree houses can be quite elaborate, but in 
              the wilderness, you have only a small window of time to construct one. Locate 
              a large spreading tree such as a Southern Live Oak or Deodar Cedar; use two or 
              more horizontally growing limbs as the foundation for a platform. Lash branches 
              perpendicular to the live limbs to create your floor, use forked branches to 
              construct a guardrail around the perimeter and rig a tarp into an A-frame above 
              the platform for protection from the rain.

            <p> Whether indoors or out, every kitchen has the same basic requirements – a place to 
              cook, prep food, store tools and supplies, and clean. Although folding camp tables 
              provide an instant workstation, you can make a simple workspace from the natural 
              materials in the area. Use rocks, logs, or tree forks for the legs of your table; the 
              key is to make sure they are reasonably level. Choose two or three branches of equal 
              length that span the distance between the table legs, lay them out parallel and 8” 
              apart. Collect a bundle of sturdy twigs cut to 20” to form the top of the table; lash 
              them, closely spaced, to the three base pieces.

        <ion-card-content>
          <p> Materials like grasses, the long fibers of palm and cattail leaves, or the interior 
            bark layer of cedar trees are perfect for making cordage. Group several strands of 
            differing lengths into a bunch and tie a knot in the end. Make several tight twists in 
            a clockwise direction with half of the fibers and wrap them counter clockwise around the 
            straight strands; repeat the process with the second half of the fibers. As the strands 
            begin to thin, simply splice in new ones and keep twisting. The different lengths you started 
            out with ensuring that you are not making all of your splices in the same spot.

            <h1>Tie the Knot</h1>
            <h3>Essential knots everyone should know</h3>
          </ion-card-header>
          <ion-card-content>
            <p> An infinite number of knots exist, but not all of them are appropriate for all 
              purposes. Different situations often require different knots. To make a closed loop at 
              the end of a rope, use a bowline knot. The taut-line hitch is an adjustable knot 
              frequently used to tie down tent corners; the adjustability allows the knot to be 
              tightened. The half hitch is a weight-bearing knot, ideal for hanging a hammock or 
              suspending a bear bag in the trees. And if you need a little leverage moving a large 
              log, combine a timber hitch with a couple of half-hitches for a tight grip and a high 
              weight capacity.

            <h3>Learn this simple construction technique</h3>
          </ion-card-header>
          <ion-card-content>
            <p> An age-old method of wrapping cordage around two or more objects to bind them together, lashing 
              provides a strong but flexible connection. The technique works so well because each wrap adds pressure 
              that makes the bond tougher. Like knots, different lashing patterns perform different functions – 
              connecting a horizontal limb to a vertical tree trunk or making an A-frame for a shelter. To make a 
              cross brace, lay out your sticks, hold the end of your twine on top of the horizontal part, wrap 
              counterclockwise around the vertical branch, downward around the horizontal, and clockwise around the 
              vertical branch. Continue wrapping in this method 10 – 12 more times and tie a square knot in the end.

            <p> The shelters, tents, and outdoor kitchen are set up, the fire is roaring, and the kids are getting bored; 
              it’s time to play. Send the young ones on a scavenger hunt to collect leafs, seeds, and sticks; something 
              smooth, something rough, and something green. Include man-made litter, reinforcing the importance of taking 
              care of our natural areas. Instead of a sand castle, build a twig fortress. Paint or mark a Tic-Tac-Toe board 
              on top of a stump or log; collect and mark stones for the playing pieces. Take lots of Glo sticks; placed in 
              plastic bottles, they provide beautiful illumination for nighttime bowling.

          <ion-card-content>
            <p> Proper sanitation is perhaps more 
              important in the wilderness than it is a home, and vital if you are in a wilderness area that falls within bear territory. Never leave out food or garbage; store both in airtight containers secured in the trees. Other items such as toothpaste, perfumes, and shampoos can also attract animals. Store these items in airtight containers away from your sleeping quarters. Set up a washing station complete with water jug, liquid soap, and paper towels; hang wet clothes on an improvised clothesline. And always change into clean nightclothes before turning in; you will sleep more comfortably and your tent will stay fresher.

            <ion-card-content>
              <p> Human waste attracts flies, spreads disease, and pollutes water sources if not disposed of properly. Human feces should be buried at least 
                200 feet away from your campsite and any waterways. Choose a spot that is inconspicuous in an area not likely to be used by others to dig a ‘cathole’. The most commonly accepted method of disposal, a ‘cathole’ should measure 6” – 8” deep and 4” – 6” wide. Cover with soil and natural materials. In some ecologically sensitive areas – river canyons and extensive floodplains, campers are required to pack out their waste. So check with the appropriate land management agency before you go.
