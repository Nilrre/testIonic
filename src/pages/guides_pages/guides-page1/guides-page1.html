        <h1>Survivalist's Tool Kit</h1>
        <h3>Essentials for covering any contingency</h3>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>
          <p> Contingencies in the wilderness abound, so it is 
            important to plan for as many as possible. A compass 
            will help you find your way; even better is a handheld 
            GPS device. Flashlights and glow sticks help you find 
            your way in the dark, and a flare gun will assist others 
            in finding you during an emergency. For setting up camp, 
            Paracord or rope, a tarp, duct tape, and cable ties are 
            indispensable. Also vital is a good multi-tool, folding 
            shovel, and gloves. Include waterproof matches, lighter, 
            and fire starting kit; redundancy is a good thing in this 
            instance. In a small tin, pack fishhooks and line, razor 
            blades, sewing needles and thread, safety pins, nails, a 
            small magnet, and some cash.

        <h1>How to Pack</h1>
        <h3>Simple tips for packing your backpack</h3>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>
          <p> A properly packed backpack is requisite to your comfort 
            and safety. Incorrect weight distribution leads to muscle 
            aches and unnecessary strain on your spine. Place heavy 
            items – water, food, and cooking gear – in the middle of 
            your pack, close to your body. Use medium weight items – 
            clothing, tarps, and rain gear – to cushion the heavier 
            items, securing them, so the weight does not shift while 
            you are hiking. Pack your sleeping bag in the bottom of your 
            backpack or tie to the bottom. Store items that you are likely 
            to need more frequently in the side and outer pockets – compass 
            and map, sunglasses, toilet tissue and trowel, sunscreen, bug 
            repellent, pocketknife, flashlight, snacks, and a small towel.

        <h1>What to Wear</h1>
        <h3>Pack for layering</h3>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>
          <p> Depending on the geographic location of the wilderness area 
            you are visiting and the time of year, temperatures can vary 
            dramatically over the course of 24 hours. Layer your clothing 
            to stay warm and keep your pack light. Pack silk long johns, 
            t-shirts, trekking pants that convert to shorts, underwear, 
            socks, and nightclothes. A fleece jacket, windbreaker, and 
            waterproof outer jacket should be enough to handle most 
            conditions. Wear a good pair of hiking boots, but pack a 
            pair of sandals and water shoes. Round out your wardrobe with 
            gloves, hat, and a scarf.

        <h1>Cool Multi-tools</h1>
        <h3>Must have survival tools</h3>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>
          <p> For flexibility, a good multi-tool is a camper’s best friend, 
            and there are hundreds of models on the market. When comparing 
            the need for different functions and the tool’s weight, it 
            becomes apparent that simpler is better. Look for a multi-tool 
            that has a regular and serrated blade, pliers with a wire cutter, 
            carbide knife sharpener, bottle and can opener, and a lanyard loop. 
            Pay close attention to the materials and quality; look for titanium 
            handles, 154CM steel blades, and 420 stainless steel construction. If 
            you plan on carrying a small hatchet for cutting firewood, consider a 
            multi-tool hatchet and take one tool instead of two.

        <h3>What to pack</h3>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>
          <p> Plan a menu ahead of time and keep things as simple as possible. The 
            type and amount of food you carry will vary, depending on whether you 
            are traveling in a vehicle or hiking deep into the wilderness on foot. 
            If you are carrying everything on your back, pack dry and dehydrated 
            foods that you can prepare with hot water. A large variety of 
            pre-packaged meals are available at most camping stores, or you can 
            make them at home. A small bottle of oil, seasonings, granola bars, 
            summer sausage, jerky, and crackers are also good options.

        <h1>Meals in a bag</h1>
        <h3>Just add water</h3>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>
          <p> Prepackaged meals are the perfect camping food – lightweight, 
            convenient, and easy to prepare. While many prepackaged meals are 
            commercially available, you can save money, get the types of meals 
            you want, and have fun by making your own. Fill a small freezer bag 
            with 1/2 cup quick-cooking oats, a tablespoon of dry milk, a teaspoon 
            of sugar, and a handful of dried fruit and nuts for a nutritious 
            breakfast. For lunch, try a third of a cup of dry couscous, 1/2 cup 
            freeze dried vegetables, a tablespoon of shelf stable shredded Parmesan 
            cheese, a teaspoon of vegetable bullion and a few seasonings. How about 
            rice with beef and mushrooms for dinner? And let’s not forget about 
            desert; how does a mixed up fruit cobbler sound?

        <h1>Bandanas</h1>
        <h3>Multiple uses for a huble piece of cloth</h3>
      </ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-content>
        <p> Bandanas take up little or no space, have multiple uses, and can even be 
          worn as jewelry. As a medical supply, use it as a tourniquet, wound dressing, 
          smoke mask, or sling. Use bandanas to wrap around and protect delicate items 
          such as electronics and sunglasses. Use one to wash with or to wash dishes with, 
          to pre-filter water or as a napkin. Protect your head from the sun, make a 
          sweatband, or tie back your hair. If you become lost or disoriented, a brightly 
          colored bandana makes an easy-to-spot signal flag; tear strips to mark your trail.
